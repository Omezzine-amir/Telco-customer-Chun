# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Introduction

This project is dedicated to the development of machine learning models to predict customer churn in the telecom industry. The purpose of this predictive analysis is to identify customers who are likely to cancel their services and understand the key factors contributing to customer attrition. By doing so, we can develop targeted customer retention strategies and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## About the Dataset

The dataset used in this project is an IBM Sample Data Set, which provides a comprehensive view of customer demographics, service usage patterns, and account information. The dataset includes the following key columns:

- `customerID`: The unique identifier for the customer.
- `gender`: The customer’s gender (male/female).
- `SeniorCitizen`: Indicates if the customer is a senior citizen.
- `Partner`: Indicates if the customer has a partner.
- `Dependents`: Indicates if the customer has dependents.
- `tenure`: Number of months the customer has stayed with the company.
- `PhoneService`: Indicates if the customer has phone service.
- `MultipleLines`: Indicates if the customer has multiple lines.
- `InternetService`: Customer’s internet service provider (DSL, Fiber optic, etc.).
- `OnlineSecurity`: Indicates if the customer has online security services.
- `OnlineBackup`: Indicates if the customer has online backup services.
- `DeviceProtection`: Indicates if the customer has device protection services.
- `TechSupport`: Indicates if the customer has tech support services.
- `StreamingTV`: Indicates if the customer has streaming TV services.
- `StreamingMovies`: Indicates if the customer has streaming movies services.
- `Contract`: The term of the customer’s contract (Month-to-month, One year, Two year).
- `PaperlessBilling`: Indicates if the customer has paperless billing.
- `PaymentMethod`: The customer’s payment method.
- `MonthlyCharges`: The amount charged to the customer monthly.
- `TotalCharges`: The total amount charged to the customer.
- `Churn`: Indicates if the customer left within the last month.

## Context

In the competitive telecom industry, customer retention is as crucial as acquiring new customers. This dataset and the ensuing analysis offer insights into customer behavior and allow us to predict churn, which is vital for maintaining a strong customer base.

## Content

The project includes scripts for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training and evaluation, and predictions. It also includes Jupyter notebooks that provide a detailed walkthrough of the analyses and visualization of the data.

## Inspiration

The objective of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to real-world data and gain a deeper understanding of the factors that influence customer churn. Insights from this project can help telecom companies to tailor their marketing and customer service efforts more effectively.


## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the code in this repository:

- R:
  - `tidyverse`
  - `caret`
  - `randomForest`
  - `e1071`
  - `ggplot2`

Install these packages in R using the command `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "caret", "randomForest", "e1071", "ggplot2"))`.
